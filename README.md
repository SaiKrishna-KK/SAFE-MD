# SAFE-MD: Statistical Analysis and Forecasting of Crime Events in Maryland

## Overview
SAFE-MD is an innovative predictive analytics tool designed to forecast crime rates across neighborhoods in Maryland. Using advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms, SAFE-MD processes historical crime data along with socio-economic indicators to predict future crime trends. This project aims to aid policymakers, law enforcement, and community planners by providing actionable insights through a data-driven approach.

---

## Features

- **Crime Rate Prediction**: Accurately forecasts crime rates in various Maryland neighborhoods based on key socio-economic factors such as population density, unemployment rates, and education levels.
- **Streamlit Interface**: An intuitive user interface that allows stakeholders to adjust socio-economic variables dynamically and observe how these changes influence crime rates.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Utilizes robust machine learning algorithms, including RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, and Stacking models, to ensure high prediction accuracy and interpretability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Thorough analysis of crime trends across counties, revealing patterns and correlations between crime rates and socio-economic conditions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time graphical representations of the predicted crime rates, enabling stakeholders to explore the impact of changes in various socio-economic indicators.

---

## Research Motivation
The motivation behind SAFE-MD is rooted in understanding and mitigating the complex dynamics of crime. The project is driven by three primary goals:
1. **Crime Impact Mitigation**: To develop strategies that reduce crime rates effectively by identifying key factors influencing crime dynamics.
2. **Data-Driven Policy Making**: To empower policymakers with predictive insights that support proactive public safety measures and efficient resource allocation.
3. **Community Safety Enhancement**: To equip communities with data that informs safety interventions and fosters collaboration between local authorities and residents.

## Dataset

SAFE-MD uses multiple datasets to analyze crime trends:
- **FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)**: Detailed county-level crime data.
- **US Department of Labor**: Unemployment rates by county.
- **Data.gov**: School enrollment and population statistics.

### Key Data Attributes
- **Crime Categories**: Murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft.
- **Socio-Economic Variables**: Population size, unemployment rate, educational enrollment (Pre-K, K-5, 6-8, 9-12).

---

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- **Normalization**: Ensured consistent scaling of all numerical variables using StandardScaler.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converted categorical variables (like county) using OneHotEncoding for effective machine learning modeling.
- **Outliers**: Treated using Z-scores and the Interquartile Range (IQR) to prevent skewed analysis.

### Modeling Approach
The project employs multiple machine learning techniques to predict crime rates:
- **RandomForestRegressor**: Combats overfitting and handles non-linear relationships effectively.
- **GradientBoostingRegressor**: Provides strong predictive power and flexibility in optimizing model performance.
- **Stacking Ensemble**: Combines multiple models for improved prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model.

---

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Stacking model achieved the best performance with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to RandomForest and GradientBoosting.
- **Insights from EDA**:
    - Strong correlations between unemployment rates and property crimes.
    - High population densities often linked with increased violent crime rates.
    - Disparities in crime patterns across counties tied to local socio-economic conditions.

## Application Interface

SAFE-MD's Streamlit-based interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience:
- **Interactive Controls**: Sliders and dropdowns allow users to toggle variables like unemployment rate and population density.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visualization of crime predictions as users adjust socio-economic parameters.
- **Graphical Representations**: Bar charts provide an easy-to-interpret comparison of predicted crime rates.

### How to Use the Application:
1. Launch the Streamlit app.
2. Adjust the input variables (e.g., population, unemployment rate).
3. View updated crime rate predictions in real-time through intuitive visualizations.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations:
- **Data Limitations**: The model's predictions are constrained by the availability of socio-economic and crime data for certain years and counties. The data scope may not fully reflect evolving crime dynamics.
- **Model Generalizability**: While the model performs well on the available data, its predictions may be less reliable in counties with limited or missing data.

### Future Work:
- **Data Expansion**: Incorporate real-time data and additional socio-economic variables to improve model robustness.
- **Refined UI**: Expand the Streamlit interface to include more interactive features and real-time data analytics.
- **Community Engagement**: Enhance the toolâ€™s accessibility to communities, providing them with data-driven insights to foster collaboration with local authorities.
